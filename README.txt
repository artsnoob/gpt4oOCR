# gpt4oOCR

Script for a Chromium extension that uses the gpt-4o API to take a screenshot of your screen, sends the image to the API, uses OCR and copies the text in a textwindow in the extension.

Current version only copies the screen that can be seen, future version will also include the rest of the screen that can't be seen.
